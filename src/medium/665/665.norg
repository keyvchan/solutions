* Non-decreasing Array

** Greedy

*** Algorithm
    When i > i - 1:
    - Change i to `i-1`, consider the next element
    - Change i - 1 to `i`, consider the previous element

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(1)

*** Result
    - Runtime: 21 ms, faster than 97.22% of Go online submissions for Non-decreasing Array.
    - Memory Usage: 6.5 MB, less than 69.44% of Go online submissions for Non-decreasing Array.

*** Code
    - Go: {@ main.go}
