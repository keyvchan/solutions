* Increasing Triplet Subsequence

** Threshold

*** Algorithm
    Narrorw down the search space by using the threshold.
    - At beginning, two thresholds are set to the minimum and maximum value of the array.
    - At each iteration, update the min thresholds then max thresholds.

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(1)

*** Code
    - Go: {@ main.go}
