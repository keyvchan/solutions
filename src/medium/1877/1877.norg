* Minimize Pair Sum in Array

** Sort

*** Algorithm
    Noticed that when the array is sorted, the sum of the left part and right part could be minimized.

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(nlogn)
    - Space: O(1)

*** Result
    - Runtime: 512 ms, faster than 21.43% of Go online submissions for Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array.
    - Memory Usage: 9.8 MB, less than 42.86% of Go online submissions for Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array.

*** Code
    - Go: {@ main.go}
