* Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

** Non-recursive solution

*** Algorithm
    Steps:
    ~ push left node into stack, until left node is `nil`
    ~ Pop from stack, and push right node into stack

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(n)

*** Result
    - Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Go online submissions for Binary Tree Preorder Traversal.
    - Memory Usage: 2 MB, less than 40.85% of Go online submissions for Binary Tree Preorder Traversal.

*** Code
    - Go: {@ main.go}
