* Maximum Subarray
** Greedy

*** Algorithm
    when $sum < 0$, which indicates the current subarray should not be considered, so reset to 0.
    Recalculate $sum$ in reset iteration. compare max and sum

*** Complexity
    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(1)

*** Result
    - Runtime: 113 ms, faster than 60.26% of Go online submissions for Maximum Subarray.
    - Memory Usage: 9.3 MB, less than 63.19% of Go online submissions for Maximum Subarray.

*** Code
    - Go: {@ main.go}[main.go]
