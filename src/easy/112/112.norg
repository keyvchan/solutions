* Path Sum

** DFS

*** Algorithm

    Use `DFS` to traverse the tree, and check if the sum of the path is equal to the target sum.

    Noted that the leaf node is the node that has no child node, we should stop there.

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(n)

*** Result
    - Runtime: 13 ms, faster than 41.11% of C++ online submissions for Path Sum.
    - Memory Usage: 21.3 MB, less than 76.93% of C++ online submissions for Path Sum.

*** Code
    - CPP: {/ main.cpp}
