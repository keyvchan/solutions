* Length of Last Word

** String Split
*** Algorithm
    Split string by space, update the length when token is not empty.

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(n)
    - space: O(1), since we use `sting_view`, it can be assumed no extra space used.

*** Result
    - Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of C++ online submissions for Length of Last Word.
    - Memory Usage: 6.6 MB, less than 59.05% of C++ online submissions for Length of Last Word.

*** Code
    - CPP: {/ main.cpp}
