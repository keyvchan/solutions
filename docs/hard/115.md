# Distinct Subsequences



## DFS + Memoization



### Algorithm

At each position, we have two choices:
- Take the current character
- Skip the current character

Noticed that when the current character can't be used, we can only skip it


### Complexity

- Time: O(len(s) * len(t))
- Space: O(len(s) * len(t))


### Result

- Runtime: 27 ms, faster than 25.00% of Go online submissions for Distinct Subsequences.
- Memory Usage: 9.2 MB, less than 75.00% of Go online submissions for Distinct Subsequences.


### Code

- Go: [main.go](#maingo)
