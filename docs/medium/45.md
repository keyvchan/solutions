# Jump Game II
## Iterative DP
### Algorithm
It can be described as a best sum problem?
So, the problem is to find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array.
Thinking of minimum number of jumps, the end position have 0 steps clearly.
The second last position can jump 1 step to the end, or jumps 0 steps `nums[i] == 0`.
The third last position can jump 1 step to the end, or jumps `step <= nums[i]` to a position after `i`, this is the branch split.
### Complexity
- Time: O(n), potentially every position could check `nums[i]` after at most, worst case O(n^2)
- Space: O(n)
### Result
- Runtime: 598 ms, faster than 7.19% of Go online submissions for Jump Game II.
- Memory Usage: 6.4 MB, less than 28.60% of Go online submissions for Jump Game II.
### Code
- Go: [main.go](#maingo)
