# Target Sum


## Brute Force


### Algorithm

Store all result, then count the result

### Complexity

- Time: O(2^n)
- Space: O(n)

### Result

- Runtime: 3370 ms, faster than 5.14% of Go online submissions for Target Sum.
- Memory Usage: 90.7 MB, less than 5.14% of Go online submissions for Target Sum.

### Code

- Go: [main.go](#maingo)

## Up-bottom DP (caching)


### Algorithm

Similar to the brute force, but use a cache to store the result

### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

### Result

Runtime: 112 ms, faster than 49.78% of Go online submissions for Target Sum.
Memory Usage: 8.2 MB, less than 14.29% of Go online submissions for Target Sum.
