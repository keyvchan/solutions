# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree



## DFS with Multiple Return Value



### Algorithm

Use three return values to record the search status.
- `p`, `q` and `ancestor`

left subtree and right subtree have its own `p` and `q`.

The `p` and `q` have multiple status.
- `p_l && q_l == true`, the `ancestor` is the ancestor
- `p_r && q_r == true`, the `ancestor` is the ancestor
- `(p_l || p_r) == true && (q_l || q_r) == true`, the `ancestor` is the current root
- `(p_l || p_r) == true` but `(q_l || q_r) == false`, we need to check if the current root is `q`
- `(p_l || p_r) == false` but `(q_l || q_r) == true`, we need to check if the current root is `p`
- `(p_l || p_r) == false` and `(q_l || q_r) == false`, return all false
