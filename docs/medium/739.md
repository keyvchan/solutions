# Daily Temeratures
## Brute Force
### Algorithm
Use two for loops to iterate through the array, find every result
### Complexity
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(1)
### Result
- Runtime: 1243 ms, faster than 10.48% of Go online submissions for Daily Temperatures.
- Memory Usage: 9.4 MB, less than 66.75% of Go online submissions for Daily Temperatures.
### Code
- Go: [brute-force.go](#bruteforcego)
## Stack
### Algorithm
Use a stack store all temperatures that are greater than the current temperature.
Scan from back to front, if the current temperature is greater than the top of the stack, remove it and push to the stack.
### Complexity
- Time: O(n), which n is the length of temperatures
- Space: O(n), stack size is n
### Result
- Runtime: 401 ms, faster than 17.44% of Go online submissions for Daily Temperatures.
- Memory Usage: 9.9 MB, less than 38.46% of Go online submissions for Daily Temperatures.
