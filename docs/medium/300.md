# Longest Increasing Subsequence


## Edge Case:

- If the input array is only one element long, return 0

## DFS


### Algorithm

Decision Tree:
- If `current number > max`, then `max = current number` and we can choose include it or not
- If `current number < max`, we can only not include it

### Complexity

- Time: O(2^n)
- Space: O(2^n)

### Code

- Go: [main.go](#maingo)

## DP


### Algorithm

Start from back of the array, 

### Complexity

- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n)
