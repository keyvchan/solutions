# Two Sum || - Input Array is Sorted
## Hash map
Use hash map to store visited value
**Step**: 
1. Scan from start to end, 
2. Check `target-num` in hash map, 
3. If not, inserted, 
4. If yes, return the index of the value
    1. We don't need to check the index, since key in map is smaller than current index
### Result
#### **Time Complexity**: O(n)
Since we just scan the whole array once, and query the map is O(1), so total shoule be O(n)
#### **Space Complexity**: O(n)
We will use a map to store all the nums, so the space complexity is O(n)
