# Wiggle Subsequence


## Iterative DP


### Algorithm

Thinking forward at the start of nums.
When we reach a index i, we have three choices:
- If `nums[i]` is the same as `nums[i-1]`, we don't need to include this number, so `DP[i] = max(1, DP[i-1])`
- If `nums[i]` is not the same as `nums[i-1]`
    - If `nums[i]` matched the definition of wiggle sequence, we can include this number, so `DP[i] = DP[i-1] + 1`
    - If `nums[i]` is not matched the definition of wiggle sequence, we can't include this number, but we actually have a valid sequence with length 2, so `DP[i] = max(2, DP[i-1])`

### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)
