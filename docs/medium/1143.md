# Longest Common Subsequence


## Edge Case

- The chars in string could be duplicated

## Iterative DP


### Algorithm

- Initialize a 2D array
- Loop through the string
- Loop through the other string
    - If the current char is the same, add 1 to the diagonal cell
    - Else, add the max of the current cell and the cell above
- Return the last cell

### Complexity

- Time: O(m * n)
- Space: O(m * n)

### Result

- Runtime: 10 ms, faster than 53.03% of Go online submissions for Longest Common Subsequence.
- Memory Usage: 11 MB, less than 77.46% of Go online submissions for Longest Common Subsequence.
