# Three Sum



## NOTE: 

1. The input array is not sorted, so we need to sort it first
2. Duplicates, need to shift pointer, also when A > 0, the rest of array can be ignored


## Loop + Two Pointers



### Algorithm

Observed that A + B + C = 0, using loop take A, then solve two sum


### Complexity

- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n)


### Result

- Runtime: 22 ms, faster than 99.28% of Go online submissions for 3Sum.
- Memory Usage: 7.2 MB, less than 87.22% of Go online submissions for 3Sum.

## Two Sum



### Algorithm

Use two sum to solve the problem


### Complexity

- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n)


### Result

- Runtime: 50 ms, faster than 57.46% of Go online submissions for 3Sum.
- Memory Usage: 7.2 MB, less than 93.14% of Go online submissions for 3Sum.
