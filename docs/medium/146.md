# LRU Cache
## Design
### LRU Cache
- least: a list, the tail is always be the least recently used
- least_index: a map, store all the index of the least recently used, incase we update the leasts
- capacity: the capacity of the cache
- store: a map, store the key-value pair
### Get
- if the key is in the store, move accessed key in leasts and return the value
- if the key is not in the store, return -1
### Set
- if the key is in the store, update the value and move the key in leasts
- if the key is not in the store, insert the key in leasts, we consider the capacity here
### Complexity
- Time: Get and Set should be all O(1)
- Space: leasts is O(n), store is O(n), least_index is O(n), capacity is O(1)
### Result
- Runtime: 899 ms, faster than 31.72% of Go online submissions for LRU Cache.
- Memory Usage: 82.2 MB, less than 38.07% of Go online submissions for LRU Cache.
### Code
- Go: [main.go](#maingo)
