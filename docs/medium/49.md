# Group Anagrams



## Hash map



### Algorithm

brute force the whole array, for each element, check rests is the anagram, exclude matched.


### Result

- Time: Execeeded time limit :(.


## Hash map + array



### Algorithm

Use char count as key, and array of string as value.


### Result

- Runtime: 24 ms, faster than 83.30% of Go online submissions for Group Anagrams.
- Memory Usage: 8.8 MB, less than 32.34% of Go online submissions for Group Anagrams.


### Code

- Go: [main.go](#maingo)



## Hash Map + Sort



### Algorithm

Use sorted string as key


### Complexity

- Time: O(nklogk), n is the length of strs, k is the max length of string in strs.
- Space: O(nk)


### Result

- Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 36.71% of C++ online submissions for Group Anagrams.
- Memory Usage: 20.5 MB, less than 62.52% of C++ online submissions for Group Anagrams.
