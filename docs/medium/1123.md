# Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves



## Understanding the problem

We want to find the lowest node in the tree that has all the deepest leaves as descendants. 
When the depth of a node's left and right child is equal, we can return it.


## DFS



### Algorithm

When depth of a node's left and right child is equal, we can return it.
Otherwise, we return the node with the greater depth.
