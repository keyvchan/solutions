# Search a 2D Matrix
## Binary Search with recursion
### Solution
Every row is a increasing array, so we only need to check the last element of the row to detrmine what row should be searched.
### Complexity
Time: Search which row is O(n), then search the row is O(logn), so the total time is O(n)
Space: O(1)
