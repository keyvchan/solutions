# Combination Sum II
## Edge Case
- Sum > Target, we should return immediately
- Sum == Target, we should return immediately, even len(candidates) != 0
## Sort + Backtracking
In [# Subsets II](medium/90/90.md#subsets-ii), we list all possible combinations, so we just need to pick the sum equal to target in the combinations.
[## Edge Case](#edge-case) should be handled in the backtracking.
