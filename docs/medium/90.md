# Subsets II
## Sort + Backtracking
### Algorithm:
Use sort then use backtracking to find all subsets. 
In order to eliminate duplicates, we use a last to indicate whether we should fork the recursion tree.
### Complexity:
Time: Sort: O(nlogn), Backtracking: O(n^2)
### Result
- Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Go online submissions for Subsets II.
- Memory Usage: 2.5 MB, less than 69.73% of Go online submissions for Subsets II.
