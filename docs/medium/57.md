# Insert Interval


## Edge Cases

- The new interval have three cases:
    - The new interval is before the old one
    - The new interval is after the old one
    - The new interval is inside the old one
- The original intervals is sorted and non-overlapping

## One Pass


### Algorithm

1. If new interval is before current one, insert new interval and return
2. If new interval is after current one, insert current interval and continue
3. Otherwise, new interval should be inside and overlap with current one, so update new interval

### Complexity

1. Time: O(n)
2. Space: O(1)
