# Bag of Tokens



## Btute Force



### Algorithm

Use a set to tracking used tokens, in every step, we can use any of unused tokens.


### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)


### Result

Time Limit Exceeded


### Code

- C++: [brute-force.cpp](#brute-forcecpp)


## Greedy



### Algorithm

- Sort the tokens by their value
- When we have enough power, we tend to use the token with the smallest value
- When we don't have enough power, we tend to gain the power with the largest value


### Complexity

- Time: O(nlogn)
- Space: O(1)


### Result

- Runtime: 8 ms, faster than 72.03% of C++ online submissions for Bag of Tokens.
- Memory Usage: 10.7 MB, less than 27.39% of C++ online submissions for Bag of Tokens.
