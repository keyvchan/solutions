# Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree



## DFS



### Algorithm

Use DFS to check every path is palindromic or not.
When a path is palindromic, it means the size of the set is 0 or 1.


### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)


### Result

- Runtime: 1275 ms, faster than 11.89% of C++ online submissions for Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree.
- Memory Usage: 294.3 MB, less than 22.48% of C++ online submissions for Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree.
