# Append K Integers With Minimal Sum



## Brute Force



### Algorithm:

Loop from 1 untail we have k unique numbers.


### Result

Memory Limit Exceeded


### Code

- Go: [main.go](#maingo)


## Sort + Math



### Algorithm

The idea is find the sums in between the numbers.
We can use a formula to calculate the sum of the numbers in between.
The formula is (a + b) * (b - a + 1) / 2


### Complexity:

- Time: O(nlogn)
- Space: O(1), sort does take extra space
