# Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements


## Brute Force


### Algorithm

- Use a map to store num frequency
- Sort and iterate through the array
- Reduce the frequency of the current element, and increase the frequency of the n+1
- If len(map) == 1, return count

### Complexity

- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n)

### Code

- Go: [main.go](#maingo)


## Reverse thinking


### Algorithm

In every iteration, instead of increase n-1 elements, decreast 1 elements until all elements are equal.

### Complexity

- Time: Sort should be O(nlogn), Get the result should be O(n)
- Space: Sort do take extra space, O(n) or O(1)

### Result

- Runtime: 98 ms, faster than 7.69% of Go online submissions for Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements.
- Memory Usage: 6.8 MB, less than 76.92% of Go online submissions for Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements.
