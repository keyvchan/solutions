# Longest Palindromic Substring
## DP, but TLE :(
### Algorithm
`DP[i] = max(DP[i+1], s[i]+sub[i+1], s[i])`
### Complexity
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n)
### Code
- Go: [main.go](#maingo)
## Two pointer
### Scan from middle
### Complexity
- Time: O(n^2)
- Space: O(1)
### Result
- Runtime: 8 ms, faster than 78.04% of Go online submissions for Longest Palindromic Substring.
- Memory Usage: 2.5 MB, less than 86.93% of Go online submissions for Longest Palindromic Substring.
