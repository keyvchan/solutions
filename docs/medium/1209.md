# Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String II



## Stack



### Algorithm

Use stack to keep track the last character and its count. 
- If the current character is the same as the last character in the stack, increase the count by 1. 
- Otherwise, push the current character and its count into the stack. 
- If the count of the last character in the stack is equal to k, pop it out of the stack.
