# Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K
## Sliding Window
### Algorithm
Use sliding window to match k length binary string
Noticed that the distinct substrings counts must be 2^k
### Complexity
Time: O(n)
Space: O(k), since we use map to store distinct substrings
### Edge Cases
- The slice is end inclusive, so the exit condition is `right == len(s) + 1`, the right can be equal to len(s)
- When `len(s) < k`, there is no way to match k length binary string, it always false
### Result
- Runtime: 135 ms, faster than 78.26% of Go online submissions for Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K.
- Memory Usage: 12.2 MB, less than 73.91% of Go online submissions for Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K.
