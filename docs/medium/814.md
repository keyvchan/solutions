# Binary Tree Pruning



## Note

- When only have a root node, should delete it or remain it.


## DFS post order



### Algorithm

Post order traversal:
- If the node is 0 and left and right child are nil, delete it.


### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1), stack does take extra space


### Result

- Runtime: 5 ms, faster than 5.41% of Go online submissions for Binary Tree Pruning.
- Memory Usage: 2.4 MB, less than 54.05% of Go online submissions for Binary Tree Pruning.
