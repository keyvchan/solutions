# Count Special Quadruplets



## Backtracking



### Algorithm

Every index, we have multiple choices according the count:

- `IF` Count < 3: 
    - Use the current index 
    - Not use the current index
- `ELSE IF` Count == 3: 
    - Use the current index as `d`, check it with sum
    - Not use the current index as `d`, check it with sum


### Complexity

- Time: O(2^n)
- Space: O(n)


### Code

- Go: [main.go](#maingo)
