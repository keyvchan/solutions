* Coin Change 2

** Up-to-bottom DP

*** Algorithm
    We can use the same idea as coin change problem, but we need to use a bottom-up approach. Caching by using amount and current index as key.

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(n * amount)
    - Space: O(amount)

*** Result
    - Runtime: 731 ms, faster than 5.34% of Go online submissions for Coin Change 2.
    - Memory Usage: 30 MB, less than 8.25% of Go online submissions for Coin Change 2.

*** code 
    - Go: {@ main.go}
