* Set Matrix Zeroes

** Additonal Space

*** Algorithm
    Use a vector to record the position of the zero elements.
    Then set the corresponding row and column to zero.

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(mn)
    - Space: O(m+n)

*** Results
    - Runtime: 11 ms, faster than 91.72% of C++ online submissions for Set Matrix Zeroes.
    - Memory Usage: 13.2 MB, less than 78.51% of C++ online submissions for Set Matrix Zeroes.

*** Code
    - Go: {/ main.cpp}
