* Optimal Partition of String

** Set

*** Algorithm
    Use a set to track the unique characters in the string. And clear when the character is repeated.

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(n)

*** Result
    - Runtime: 243 ms, faster than 39.06% of C++ online submissions for Optimal Partition of String.
    - Memory Usage: 44.6 MB, less than 56.56% of C++ online submissions for Optimal Partition of String.

*** Code
    - Go: {/ main.cpp}
