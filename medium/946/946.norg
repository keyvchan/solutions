* Validate Stack Sequences

** Simulation

*** Algorithm
    Use a stack to simulate the process of pushing and popping.
    When we can't push anymore, return false

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(n)

*** Result
    - Runtime: 4 ms, faster than 97.37% of Go online submissions for Validate Stack Sequences.
    - Memory Usage: 4.7 MB, less than 5.26% of Go online submissions for Validate Stack Sequences.

*** Code
    - Go: {@ main.go}
