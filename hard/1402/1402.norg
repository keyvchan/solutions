* Reducing Dishes

** DFS + Memoization

*** Algorithm
    Typical DFS + Memoization problem. 
    The memo key is `time` and index.

*** Complexity
    - Time: O(n^2), since time is n, and we have n choices for each time
    - Space: O(n^2)

*** Result
    - Runtime: 243 ms, faster than 51.61% of Go online submissions for Reducing Dishes.
    - Memory Usage: 30.7 MB, less than 51.61% of Go online submissions for Reducing Dishes.

*** Code
    - Go: {/ main.go}
